## HELLO 👋

<!--
**Marynochka1/Marynochka1** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I am hard-working, responsible, proactive, and attentive to details, easy adaptable to the different situations. The complex project isn’t issue for me because I am highly resistant to stress. I am a quick learner and always try to find the solution of the problem by myself. I successfully finished the QA manual study of Hillel IT School and QATestLab Training Center. I open for the new work and opportunities. Currently I am looking for a job as QA junior.
